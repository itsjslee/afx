## Academic Futures Exchange (AFX) is a platform that allows students to participate in a unique, performance-based network, enabling them to invest in and predict their peers' academic achievements.

By placing predictions on friends' and classmates' grades, students can compete in an environment that encourages accountability and academic excellence. AFX not only provides a fun, engaging experience but also promotes a culture of collaboration and shared academic success.
